    "body": "2020/05/15 - If there is one word to describe the world we live in today, it wouldbe, ‚Äúuncertain. ‚Äù Uncertain of what to do, where to go next, and what isgoing to happen in the near future. Everywhere we turn, the words‚Äúvirus‚Äù and ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù flood our ears, making it incredibly challengingto think of anything else. It may be tempting to try to block out theworld altogether to avoid bad news, but one thing to remember is that wemust stay informed during these times. We have to stay on top ofinformation regarding our global situation, for a number of validreasons. ¬† For one, keeping updated is a way to do our part to stop the spread ofthe virus. We all have an important role to play within our communities. We have to look out for ourselves, and those around us. You may hear thephrase, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre all in this together‚Äù quite often, and wonder what itmeans. Obviously we‚Äôre not physically together, and isolation makes itfeel like we‚Äôre actually farther apart. And no, it‚Äôs not a High SchoolMusical reference. This phrase is meant to convey that everyone iscurrently going through the same situation. It means we all need toremain united against a common threat, and work to keep ourselves andthe community safe. This can be achieved through listening to our publichealth officials, and taking proper precautions, like social distancing. One can only be aware of these precautions by keeping up with the news,and staying informed. ¬† Another reason to stay informed is knowing how to respond to challengesduring this time. Most of the world, let alone all MCI students, havenever been part of any pandemic situation before. No one knows how toact or where to begin trying to cope with all the changes. These changescause many to feel scared, helpless and not in control. By stayinginformed on new developments of the virus, as well as the necessaryprecautions to take, you are educating yourself on how to combat our newreality. This education becomes a way to feel in control, and stay ontop of the fear. A study conducted by the International Journal ofEnvironmental Research and Public Health (IJERPH) found that those whohad reliable and updated information regarding the coronavirus felt moreprepared to handle it. Also, people who received accurate informationabout the virus had lower levels of stress, anxiety and depression. Sowhen staying updated on information concerning the virus, not only areyou learning about ways to react, but you are possibly improving thestatus of your mental health. By learning more about what threatens us,we can combat fear, and remain feeling in control. ¬† Another major reason to remain informed is to stay connected with theoutside world. Through television, newspapers, and the internet, we areable to momentarily escape our self-isolation and see what is happeningthroughout the globe. For example, by watching the news, not only areyou getting information, you are seeing the contrasting effects of thevirus around the world. You get to see what other people are doing, andhow other countries are reacting. Most importantly, you get to bereminded that you are not alone, since the whole world is going throughthe same thing. Getting information and updates is your ticket toexperiencing the world once again, because it allows you to see whatothers are doing. ¬† Finally, although our world may seem scary and uncertain, it is also onethat will go down in the history books. People will remember these pastfew months as the worst crisis since WWII, meaning we are all makinghistory. I‚Äôd like to believe our children or even grandchildren may askabout this time; how it felt to live in self-isolation, be off fromschool, and watch everything around us shut down. In order to speak toour experiences, we should be aware of what‚Äôs happening throughout theworld. Even though this crisis is terrible, we should be immersingourselves in the current information and updates, so we remember whenit‚Äôs over. Those who weren‚Äôt present during this time will want to knoweverything, and I, for one, want to be able to share it. So, think aboutit like this: staying informed is a way to truly be a part of thisevent, and if we don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on around us, we may be lettinga historic occurrence pass us by. ¬† To conclude, it is really important to remain informed and updated aboutthe virus, as well as other current events around the world. Now, thisdoesn‚Äôt mean glueing yourself to the TV or reading every newspaperarticle. You can be informed by just watching the news once a day, for abrief period of time. Alternately, you can go online to the Globe andMail, the New York Times, the Washington Post, or countless othernewspaper sources, and read a couple articles. By taking ten minutes outof each day, you can learn so much about what is happening around you. Being informed is all about feeling confident and resilient enough to goabout your daily life, without feeling worried. We must remember thateven in a world of uncertainty, there are ways to fight back, and remainin control. ¬† Sources: https://cmha. bc. ca/covid-19-stay-informed/ ¬† https://www. mdpi. com/1660-4601/17/5/1729 Image Source: ‚ÄúThe New York Times Newspaper‚Äù by cottonbro from Pexels "

    "title": "Female Representation in Journalism: A Harsh Reality ",
    "body": "2020/05/15 - Imagine you get a job in your dream field of work. You start off well,yet after a while, you realize that your role in the company is notadvancing and your work is being limited. This is how women injournalism feel on a daily basis. Despite the major strides maderegarding gender equality, the world of journalism is still veryimbalanced when it comes to the representation of males versus females. In recent years, studies and data have shown that there are more femalesmaking up journalism students in universities and colleges. Yet, femalesonly make up 39% of newsrooms. Therefore, the news is predominantlycovered by men. ¬† A lot of this imbalance in representation comes from past and currentgender stereotypes. In 2016, it was reported that in the United States,fields of reporting with over 50% of female representation includedlifestyle, education, and healthcare. Whereas, there was less that 30%of female representation in topics such as sports, weather, and crimeand justice. In Canadian newsrooms, many major news organizations havealso shown large gender gaps, according to a 2015 study. The GlobalMedia Monitoring Project looked into 23 Canadian news organizations,including CBC, CTV, the Toronto Star, and the Globe and Mail. They found that only 43% of reporters were female, and that only 31% ofwomen reporters had covered stories regarding politics and government. Additionally, the study found that women were more likely than men toinclude female sources in their articles. ¬† You must be wondering: Why is equal representation in the newsimportant? One major reason that gender equality in the media matters isbecause women bring new and different perspectives to journalism,sparking more interest in global news and creating a broader audience. The Women‚Äôs Media Center put out a study in 2017, outlining theconsequences of a lack of female representation in journalism. The studystated that in 12 top U. S. news outlets, campus sexual assault storieswere mainly written by men. In these stories, male journalists were morelikely to focus on the impact on the perpetrator, and his behavioursurrounding rape charges. On the other hand, female journalists whocovered sexual assault were more likely to focus on the victim‚Äôsbehaviour, and how rape impacted them. This is just one examplerevealing a difference in perspective that occurs when the same type ofstory is covered by a man or a woman. Women also emphasize differentideas than men. A study in 2013 found that women writing editorialpieces prominently used words including abuse, assault, children,equality, education, discrimination, and violence. This difference insubject matter and perspective is important to have in the media,especially in news and broadcasting. It provides a more detailed andcomprehensive story, helping the audience to become better-informed. ¬† Now, there is one major question left: Is it possible to have equalrepresentation in newsrooms, and how can we achieve it? Firstly, it isTOTALLY possible to represent males and females equally in journalism!The world of reporting, broadcasting, and news would be far better ifthere were many contrasting perspectives on world issues. Journalismcould be elevated from what it is now, to keep national and globalaudiences engaged and well-informed. To achieve this proper balance, wecan be aware of the challenges that women in journalism face, and standup for their right to equal representation and opportunities. We can useour voices, as well as social media platforms to advocate for thiscause, and inform those around us about the issue. ¬† Image Source: ‚ÄúWoman Writing in Notebook‚Äù by Ivan Samkov from Pexels "

    "body": "2020/05/01 - The latest conflict between the Wet‚Äôsuwet‚Äôen Hereditary Chiefs and theirsupporters, and those supporting the Coastal GasLink Pipeline hasrevealed that Canada remains set in its role as a colonizer. Before thebeginning of this year, it may have been easy to deny that Canadaremains a colonizing power, but no longer can that appeal to ignorancebe made. ¬† For those unfamiliar with the situation, here are the main events. Atthe beginning of this year, following a Dec. 31st injunction from theB. C. Supreme Court, militarized RCMP officers raided a camp of FirstNations land defenders, arresting people on their sovereign territory. In reaction, protesters led demonstrations and blocked railways acrossthe country. ¬† The actions of these protesters and the original Wet'suwet'en landdefenders have been highly criticized across Canada in ways that aremisguided and problematic. The record must be set straight. An RCMP raid on Wet‚Äôsuwet‚Äôen land amounts to an invasion of a foreignnation. According to the Canadian law and the United Nations Declarationon the Rights of Indigenous People, these land defenders have the rightto self-governance and territorial sovereignty. ¬† This is an act of colonial exploitation. Canada is a colonial power. Canada was created to extract natural resources. To do this, theCanadian Government along with private corporations killed, ethnicallycleansed, and commited cultural genocide against First Nations people. We saw this in Residential Schools, in the Sixties Scoop and we continueto see it today. This was done to free up land for both resourceextraction and settlers to do the work. It is inherently racist andmorally abhorrent in every way. ¬† A common misconception is that the pipeline is legitimate and acceptedbecause the elected band council system has okayed it. It must berecognized though, that the elected band council is a system put intoplace by the Indian Act to make band councils more similar to othercolonial governments. According to the traditional Wet'suwet'en systemof government, the Hereditary Chiefs are the true and legitimateleaders. This has been upheld by the Supreme Court. Finally, putting all this aside, there should be no pipelines. At all. Anywhere. We are in a climate emergency. Arguments are made about theeconomy and the need to slowly ease off fossil fuels. Unfortunately, thetime for that is long gone. Science says we need to stop producing oiland natural gas now. Many Canadians are unaware of these issues, but it has becomeincreasingly important in political discourse in recent years. Recentmovement towards ‚ÄúReconciliation‚Äù would have the average citizen believethat Canada and its government have ceased colonial actions and areworking to right the wrongs done over the past 400 years. This mostrecent conflict clearly shows that the government cares not forIndigenous Peoples‚Äô rights when there is money to be made. Reconciliation is a farce while colonization continues. Knowing this,when you stand for O Canada, ask yourself: Do you stand for colonialism?Do you stand for cultural genocide? Do you stand for ignoring humanrights? If not, consider staying seated. ¬† *Opinion Piece * Image source: ‚ÄúWet'suwet'en Solidarity Event - Rail Yard near PioneerVillage Station Blockaded - Vaughan, Toronto, Ontario - February 15,2020. ‚Äù By Jason Hargrove fromFlickr "

    "body": "2020/04/30 - Recently, I picked up the book Mindset by Carol Dweck and becameobsessed. While I run the risk of being melodramatic, I must say thatthis book has offered me a new perspective on life and a solution to aproblem that I once thought unsolvable. Now, before I go into anyfurther details, I want to ask you, the reader, a question. Do you thinkthat intelligence is something you are born with or something you candevelop? ¬†Before reading this book I always believed that intelligence, amongother attributes, was a fixed value that couldn‚Äôt be altered. I believedthat while hard work could allow you to accomplish more, it wouldn‚Äôtchange your inherent aptitude for something. For example, when I woulddo poorly on a math or science test (and trust me this happened far toooften), I would tell myself that ‚Äúscience just wasn‚Äôt my thing. ‚Äù Theproblem with this mentality is that it didn't allow room for growth. Inmy head, it felt irrational and too challenging to constantly put moreeffort into science. Sure, I could study a week in advance for everyscience test, but what was the point? I didn‚Äôt want to keep putting myblood, sweat and tears into science just to stay on par with the rest ofmy marks, or peers (who I believed had natural aptitudes for science). What I didn‚Äôt understand though, is that nobody can sustainably excel atsomething without putting work in. Intelligence and skills can becultivated in almost every facet of your life. Personality,intelligence, athletic ability, social skills etc. can all be developed,over time, through hard work, good strategies and input from others. ¬†By viewing our attributes, and others', as fixed values, we are forcedto place our self-esteem on our natural abilities alone. So, when facedwith failure, we are devastated as we believe that we will neverovercome them fully. Conversely, with a growth mindset, you spend lesstime worrying about how talented or  good  at something you are andfocus instead on learning and growing your abilities. Often, when facedwith criticism or failure, we retract into feelings of insecurity anddefensiveness, which directly inhibits our growth and opportunity tolearn from our mistakes. People are born with an inherent love forlearning, but a fixed mindset, derived from society's institutionalizedhabit of praising natural ability, ruins this. We live in a world wherewe believe people are either innately superior or inferior and,therefore, we stick to easy tasks that we excel in, to repeatedly affirmour feelings of superiority, while simultaneously avoiding things thatexpose our inferiority. We sweep under the rug, the parts of our lifethat need the most nurturing and attention, leaving them more neglectedand weak than ever before. With this behaviour, we slam the door on anychance of genuine improvement and growth by letting our conquerableweaknesses constantly hold us back from our true potential. For this new year, I urge you to reignite your passion for learning byletting go of your fear of failure through the belief that skills andability can be grown and cultivated. Unfortunately, I can't get intoall the nitty-gritty details about what a growth mindset is and how toachieve it (it‚Äôll take up the entire Beacon), so I strongly urge you toread Dr. Dweck's book. It‚Äôs important to note though that real change and improvement will takecommitment and patience. You can‚Äôt expect to immediately flourish atsomething you are weak in, just by suddenly putting more effort in. Itwill take dedication and time to hone your skills and help them developto the standard at which you want them. The main idea is to not getdiscouraged. When I first took on this mindset, believe it or not, Iperformed worse than I usually do. But instead of giving up, I pressedon and used my low marks to determine my mistakes and how to betterprepare in the future. If you are reading this and somehow haven‚Äôt gotten bored from myrambling, I sincerely hope that you are motivated and interested intaking up this new attitude and perspective on life. Our world needsmore growth-minded people than ever before, as we live in a world withinfinite possibilities and challenges that can only be overcome by thosemost willing to try. As I wrap this up, I'll leave you with one lastpiece of advice: NEVER - especially in the face of adversity - fixate onyour present ability, but instead on your potential, what is possibleand what you can become.

    "body": "2020/04/30 - COVID-19 is spreading quickly - so quickly, in fact, that by the timethis article is released, these statistics will already be out ofdate*. When news of the virus reached the international community, themajority of the coverage was focused on China, particularly on themillions under quarantine in the province of Hubei. However, by the endof February, there was news of outbreaks in South Korea, Italy, andIran. By mid-March, the majority of the world was under quarantine asoutbreaks spread across the world. ¬† COVID-19 has been spreading rapidly around the world, with over onemillion cases and 56,000 confirmed deaths. Canada currently has 12,000confirmed cases and over 170 deaths. The United States, however, hasquickly become an epicenter for the virus, with over 265,000 cases and6,700 deaths. An online polling survey by Leger suggests that Americansaren't taking isolation as seriously as Canadians - only 86% of USrespondents were adhering to the required 2 metre distance rules, incomparison to 95% of Canadians. Although this number might seem small,it could be a significant factor in determining the death tolls in bothcountries. ¬† Disinformation is still prominent in the battle against COVID-19, andundermines public attempts to fight it. From online posts claiming thatlemons ward off the virus, to Fox News anchors saying that holding yourbreath for more than ten seconds will prevent it, disinformation iswidespread. Worse still, people‚Äôs attempts to try to make a profit offof selling their own home remedies do more than damage their personalcredibility - they can prevent individuals, who have the disease, fromgetting life-saving treatment. While choosing not to spread disinformation might be an easy choice,what the governments of the world are faced with today is far from easy. As the world goes into quarantine in an attempt to contain the spread ofthe virus, economic activity halts. This poses many problems, and it isinevitable that massive job losses follow. ¬† In a one week period thisMarch, the government of Canada received nearly 500,000 applications forunemployment insurance, an amount only matched by an eight monthperiod during the recession in 2009. This presents a moral dilemma - achoice between people‚Äôs lives, and their livelihoods. ¬† The governments of the world, as this crisis continues to unfold, willhave to tread carefully. Are they prepared to deal with a potentialdepression, and the mental health issues and business failures thatwould result from it? There are no easy answers, and this is not an easysituation. All we can do is stay safe as best we can, and practisesocial distancing for the good of our country and the world. ¬† * This article was originally released on April 3rd, 2020.

It‚Äôs not worth the effort to pullout a book, there‚Äôs no access to your favourite TV show, and you wantsomething a bit more rewarding than listening to music. The solution„Éºpodcasts! Podcasts are one of the most underappreciated forms of mediaout there. They are audio programs that focus on the spoken word, like aradio talk show but better. Podcasts are easily accessible, widelyavailable, and there is a podcast for everyone out there, whether you‚Äôrelooking for lighthearted comedy, news and politics, or dramaticstorytelling. But where to start? In a day and age where time isliterally money and there are thousands of forms of entertainment allvying for your attention, it can seem overwhelming to decide what tochoose. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here to help! I‚Äôve chosen a couple of my all timefavourite podcasts (and I listen to a lot of podcasts). So, whetheryou‚Äôre brand new to the world of podcasts or an experienced veteran,here are some of my suggestions that I hope each of you will at leastgive a try. Enjoy!  The Anthropocene Reviewed by John GreenThe Anthropocene Reviewed is a monthly podcast about all things human. In this podcast, John Green (author of The Fault in Our Stars amongother things) reviews anything and everything on a five star scale. Thetopics range from the QWERTY keyboard to velociraptors to teddy bears toSuper Mario Kart. On the surface it may seem like a shallow, fun-time,but it often delves deep into what connects us all and makes us humanthrough the lens of ridiculous and everyday objects and events. By theend of an episode about hot dog eating contests you may be having anexistential crisis about the worth of your own existence and why we‚Äôreall really here. Sometimes heartbreaking and sometimes uplifting, everyepisode is a new and delightful discovery about what it means to behuman. Episodes are about half an hour long and there‚Äôs no set order orplot, so you can pick it up anywhere, but you may find yourself bingelistening like I do. It‚Äôs one of my all time favourite podcasts becauseI love the juxtaposition of absurd topics and thoughtful discussion. It‚Äôll make you laugh one moment and cry the next, which is why Irecommend The Anthropocene Reviewed.  Myths and Legends by Jason and Carissa WeiserMyths and Legends is a weekly podcast retelling old musty myths in anew, funky way. This podcast aims to tell stories, from (in)famous taleslike Robin Hood and Hansel and Gretel to ones you may have neverheard of but will love, like The Eyrie and Meng Jiangnu and the GreatWall. It also features a ‚ÄúCreature of the Week‚Äù segment, discussingfoolish and fantastical creatures from myths all over the world. JasonWeiser recounts these tales in a way that‚Äôs entertaining, funny, andkeeps you on the edge of your seat. This podcast is an old favourite ofmine because it‚Äôs lighthearted and comforting, like a good chickennoodle soup. Myths and Legends is something that I go back to time andagain because it‚Äôs casual enough to listen to while doing chores orother mind numbing tasks, funny and entertaining, but still carry alesson. Episodes are usually half an hour to an hour long; some storiessplit into sagas several episodes long, but most are individualinstallments you can pick and choose from. I‚Äôd recommend Myths andLegends to anyone looking for an interesting and educationalstorytelling podcast.  Science Vs by Gimlet MediaScience Vs is a weekly podcast that examines controversial topics in ascience focused way. Narrated by Wendy Zuckerman and produced by GimletMedia, this podcast covers many topics, from police shootings to killerasteroids to the coronavirus to vaping. It‚Äôs a great surface levelintroduction to these topics and many more, debating the pros and consand often bringing in experts to talk about them. Science Vs is botheducational and entertaining to listen to, and the topics are often veryrelevant to current events or everyday life. I like the informationalyet conversational tone of the podcast and that it gives a generic ideaof the topic without going too in depth, so it can be informativewithout feeling stuffy and formal. Episodes are about an hour long andstand alone, so you can listen to just what piques your interest withoutbeing dragged down by over a hundred episodes. I‚Äôd recommend ScienceVs to anyone interested in learning something new in a fun and engagingway. I encourage you to go explore podcasts on Spotify, Soundcloud, or anyother digital platform.

    "body": "2020/04/04 - Hey Bears! Earth Hour 2020 (Saturday March 28th, 2020, at 8:30 pm)is rapidly approaching. You probably already know what Earth Hour is,and you might think that it‚Äôs somewhat silly. ¬† Nobody actually believes that a bunch of people turning off somelights for one hour is going to change anything, do they? And our schoolcan‚Äôt really participate anyway. The timing doesn‚Äôt allow it and if weturn off our lights, the school will be plunged into darkness. Indeed, it is an unfortunate truth that MCI‚Äôs notorious lack of windowsand natural lighting makes it difficult for us to celebrate Earth Hour. And yes, we obviously can‚Äôt ‚Äúproperly‚Äù participate because there‚Äôs noschool on the 28th. There won‚Äôt ever be school during Earth Hour, sinceit takes place in the evening and on the last Saturday of March. Regardless, MCI and many other schools do their bit on the Fridaybefore. But the question still remains - does Earth Hour make a difference?According to the mission statement of EarthHour. org, (the officialwebsite for‚Ä¶ well, Earth Hour), the main purpose of Earth Hour is tomake a symbolic commitment to the betterment of our environment. Theevent is meant to ‚Äúspark global conversations on protecting nature notonly to combat the climate crisis, but to ensure our own health,happiness, prosperity and even survival. ‚Äù The carbon emission reduction of the event is indeed negligible (Gollom,2014), but millions of people across 180 countries participate in EarthHour every year, meaning they have taken the time out of their day toconsider how they as individuals can impact the planet. ¬† Yes, Earth Hour is simplistic. Anyone can do it and the second it‚Äôsover, we can continue on with our wasteful, energy-guzzling, consumerlifestyles. But for that brief hour, people are acting in unity for ourenvironment. Any act of positive unity in our increasingly morecomplicated society is a moment to be cherished. So if you can, pleasedo consider participating in Earth Hour 2020 with your families andconserve energy whenever possible to carry on the spirit ofenvironmental stewardship. Energy conservation tips include: turning off lights that are not inuse, unplugging appliances that are not in use (yeah it‚Äôs annoying toplug them in again, but come on! That‚Äôs a first world problem if I everheard one) and changing to energy efficient lights and appliances (thistip does depend on how cool your parents are, of course). The internetis at your fingertips for more information on how you can make adifference, of course. ¬† Happy Earth Hour, MCI!

    "body": "2020/02/01 - The winter holidays are a time to embrace the spirit of togetherness, bemerry, and spend time with family. Unfortunately, something happened inNovember that has quickly become one of the most heated issues in Canada(and could lead to awkward conversations with the extended family aroundthe dinner table). This event was the firing of Don Cherry. You‚Äôveprobably heard about this, but in case you haven‚Äôt, here is a briefrundown of what happened. On Remembrance Day, the 85-year-old NHLcommentator went after immigrants in Toronto and Mississauga, accusingthem of not wearing poppies and not honouring Canada‚Äôs veterans. Undoubtedly the part that drew the most criticism was his use of thewords ‚Äúyou people. ‚Äù The statement quickly drew widespread criticism, and Sportsnet fired DonCherry. Don Cherry, throughout his history as a broadcaster, has had ahistory of making very controversial statements. These instances includethe time when he complained about ‚Äúwom[e]n yapping away‚Äù at hockeygames or when he said vulgar things about Liberals at the 2010 inauguralmeeting of Toronto‚Äôs new city council, describing the Liberal media as‚Äúleft-wing pinkos‚Äù, and ‚Äúkooks‚Äù. One of the things that may have contributed to Cherry‚Äôs firing was hisunwillingness to apologize. In an interview he did with Fox News, hesaid that he might have used different wording if he could have done itover, but came nowhere near giving a formal apology. Not only were Cherry‚Äôs comments offensive, but they were inaccurate andcounterproductive. While the sentiment of getting people to appreciateall that our veterans have sacrificed for Canada is good, Cherry failedto take into account that immigrants are also part of the Canadianmilitary. Sergeant Stephen Thomas, 37, is a first-generation Canadianwith parents from Guyana, who served two tours in Afghanistan, and wasshocked by Cherry‚Äôs comments. He said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs realized howmuch the military has changed over the last decade or two. ‚Äù The reason Don Cherry was fired was that his comments, whetherintentional or unintentional (as his supporters claim), hurt people. Hisracist, sexist, and rude comments throughout the years may have been fewand far between, but the fact that he was unwilling to apologize says alot about his character. His firing is a stepping stone in slowlygetting rid of the voices of discrimination better left in the past. Onthis holiday, in the spirit of togetherness, we should all recognizewhat Cherry could not - that no matter what country we were born in, weare all Canadian.

    "body": "2020/02/01 - A guide to tree-ting this season right (filled with history,controversies, and more!) It has begun. Everyone has simultaneously agreed, as if some telepathicphenomenon has occurred, and set out to accomplish one thing. 98. 1 CHFIhas Toronto‚Äôs Christmas Music Station; stores have transformed to fitconsumer holiday needs; Canada‚Äôs Wonderland has created Winterfest; andso on. However, the question comes to mind: are you completely prepared forthe holiday season? If you answered no, read this guide! If you answeredyes, read this guide! ReSPECT; don‚Äôt ReGIFT! Regifting- although harmless when done thoughtfully- requires carefulattention and etiquette. There are certain rules one must pay heed towhen committing such an act. Firstly, never regift anything meaningfulor handmade. Doing this will transform you into a Grinch! Secondly,regift outside of your circle of friends. This avoids awkward tensionand does not hurt the original gift-giver. Thirdly, regiftthoughtfully. For example, you would not regift a Crock-Pot to your7-year old brother; you would give it to your mom who is in need of one. ‚ÄúWhen in doubt, regift to charity. ‚Äù This saying avoids many conflictsand is a solution towards a greater good. Simply storing the gift orthrowing it away because you got the Crock-Pot 99 instead of Crock-Pot100, wastes many resources, time, and energy. Bake with a Canine Twist! What‚Äôs that I smell in your oven? Dog cookies! They are the motive thisseason. The world wide web consists of numerous recipes that you canfollow to bake such lovely treats. Please note that chocolate is a dogno-no! Controversy: Real or Fake? It has been debated out for an undocumented amount of time: should onebuy real or artificial Christmas trees? Firstly, if you have purchasedan artificial tree, reuse it for a long time to make itenvironmentally-friendly. You would have to use it for more than 20years to make it a more eco-friendly option. Real trees, however, havesurprising benefits to them. Christmas tree farms serve as a habitat forlocal wildlife, giving a home to many species. Around 350 million treesare grown on these farms, with 30 million being harvested. In theindustry continuum, these farms appear on the low end. However, it iscritical to compost or recycle your tree properly. If you‚Äôre feelingextra spicy, offer your tree to mulching and chipping programs, whichhelp grow more species for one‚Äôs garden. To conclude this controversy,buy a real, locally-grown tree. This also allows you to experience theprocess of picking the right one.

    "body": "2020/02/01 - The snow-covered street, the fear of slipping on black ice on the floor,the hope of waking up to it being a snow day are all Toronto‚Äôs ways ofsaying it is here: the winter season. Gone (too soon) are the orange andbrown leafy streets, the comforting sweater weather, the therapeuticfeeling of ordering a pumpkin spice latte albeit it's horrendous taste. Before those moments, we enjoyed the hot air, the feeling of no school,the beach outings, picnics in the parks, the gorgeous sunsets, thebeautiful long days, and the alluring shorts nights.

Otherwise known as SAD or seasonaldepression, Seasonal Affective Disorder only affects 15% of Canadianswho tend to experience a milder version of SAD. Although it might soundrare, it's important for everyone to know what it is in case it everyhappens to yourself or a loved one.

Although most people have SAD starting at the end of fall or thebeginning and continue well into the end of winter, some do have itafter winter and during the summer season.

Itcan feel never-ending but here are a few things to combat your seasonaldepression. A Sun Lamp: This lamp gives off a bright light that mimics naturaloutdoor light.

    "title": "A Year in Review: Ranking My Top 10 Films of 2019",
    "body": "2020/02/01 - Over the past twelve months, we were handed a diverse collection offilms. Be it comedies, thrillers, action movies, or dramas, filmmakersnew and old raised the bar for this medium in 2019. As the year comes toan end, I am taking a look back and ranking my top ten movies of theyear. I chose the films that challenged me as a viewer, made me thinkfor days after I watched it, and most importantly, films that were justreally fun to watch. 10. Climax Dir. Gasper No√© Climax follows a group of aspiringdancers in an abandoned school, as their rehearsal spirals out ofcontrol into madness. This film is a visually stunning, yet disturbingerotic rush from start to finish. 9. Shazam! Dir. David F. Sandberg From DC Comics, Shazam! follows14-year-old Billy Batson as he must learn how to deal with God-likesuperpowers. With family values at the core of this film and a stellarchild cast, Shazam! is the most heartwarming superhero film of the year. 8. Ad Astra Dir. James Gray Brad Pitt soars in this film whichexplores the powerful bond between a father and son. CinematographerHoyte van Hoytema delivers a visual spectacle of outer space. 7. The Peanut Butter Falcon Dir. Tyler Nilson, Michael Schwartz Ayoung man with down syndrome escapes his nursing facility with dreams ofattending a wrestling school. Shia LaBeouf is mesmerizing in thischarming homage to a Mark Twain classic. 6. Midsommar Dir. Ari Aster Midsommar is a confusing, thoughtprovoking, and ambitious film. Director Ari Aster creates anothermasterfully crafted horror film that almost rivals Aster‚Äôs previousclassic, Hereditary. 5. The Lighthouse Dir. Robert Eggers Robert Pattinson and WillemDafoe give strong performances in this wicked tale of two lighthousekeepers on a distant island in New England. Robert Eggers reallysolidifies himself as a strong filmmaker in the horror genre with thisfilm. 4. Rocketman Dir. Dexter Fletcher Taron Egerton gives his bestperformance yet with Rocketman. I think it's going to be a long longtime until another film succeeds in creating a movie musical biopic asintense as Rocketman. 3. Booksmart Dir. Olivia Wilde Olivia Wilde‚Äôs directorial debut is acoming-of-age comedy between two best friends and academic‚Äòoverachievers‚Äô who realize that they‚Äôve wasted their high school yearsslaving away instead of having fun. Booksmart is a wild and fast-pacedmovie that is clever in its portrayal of teenagers. 2. Joker Dir. Todd Phillips Joker is a heartbreaking and brutaltake on the clown prince of crime‚Äôs origin story. Todd Phillips drawsheavy inspiration from films such as Taxi Driver and The King of Comedyto construct his tale of a man disregarded by society. Phillips‚Äôs Gothamis corrupt and crime ridden, but it‚Äôs the realism that helps amplify thefilm‚Äôs critique of a society that dismisses its citizens. JoaquinPhoenix gives a disturbing performance as Arthur Fleck that at times maycall on the viewer to sympathize with him but strictly acknowledges hisvile actions. Todd Phillip‚Äôs direction and Lawrence Sher‚Äôs beautifulcinematography accompanied by HildurGu√∞nad√≥ttir‚Äôshypnotizing score help make Joker standout film from 2019 that must beviewed more than once to fully grasp. 1. Parasite Dir. Bong Joon-ho Bong Joon-ho‚Äôs Parasite isundoubtedly 2019‚Äôs must see film. Every aspect of this film from itscast to its cinematography is fantastic. Parasite‚Äôs depiction ofthemes of class, wealth, and dignity are apparent but not in your face. Joon-ho‚Äôs slow yet persistent race to the end will keep you on the edgeof your seat. Parasite follows the extremely poor Kim family as theylaunch an all-out assault on the blatantly wealthy Park family. WhenKim‚Äôs son, Ki-Woo, secures a job as a tutor for the daughter of the Parkfamily, he opens the door for the rest of his family to infiltrate thePark‚Äôs home. The Kim family makes quick work of ridding the Parkfamily‚Äôs employees and securing their jobs through tactical and cunningplans. Each member of the Kim family has a moment to shine. The filmstarts off presenting itself as a satirical comedy but takes a jarringturn into brutality. The film spirals out of control in front of youreyes and you are forced to view every disturbing second of it. Bong‚Äôsmastery of the camera and formulation of violence is electrifying inParasite. This film is truly an unforgettable piece of cinema will bedeconstructed, examined, and celebrated for years to come.

However, for some people, the holidays are dull, with no school tooccupy their days, and friends gone on vacations. But fear not, thereare still so many things to do.  Anything snow-related: Take advantage of the season and get outthere. Build a snowman, go sledding or skating, or have a snowballfight. Winter is also the time to ski, or try something moreoutlandish, like ice fishing or snow sculpting. One of my favouritethings to do is build a snow fort with my friends. ¬† Indoor activities: However fun it is to play in the snow, it‚Äôscold. But inside, you can make crafts (a great gift idea), catch upon your reading, draw (the snowy landscape will provide lots ofinspiration), or learn to cook something new. Also, drink hotchocolate, especially after playing in the snow (that‚Äôs the besttime to drink it).  Go to a concert: There are lots of concerts in December, manywith holiday themes. So whether you‚Äôd like to go see your favouriteartist, or maybe go somewhere new, there will definitely besomething to peak your interest.  Catch up with old friends: I have many friends from elementaryschool who I haven‚Äôt seen in a long time. The break is a great timeto reach out and plan a time to get together.

News, entertainment, music, etc. - withjust the push of a button it‚Äôs all there. However, with this newfoundfreedom comes a price that I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre already aware of. What we sayonline is usually different, sometimes to an extreme, than what we sayin real life. Most of the warnings that we hear about online safetyinclude never giving away your personal information, or being mindful ofwhat it is you‚Äôre saying. But what we don‚Äôt hear about as often is howyour personality itself can change. ¬† Let‚Äôs say that you‚Äôre on an app that connects you to other people (yourfriends, family, even strangers), and you suddenly see something thatinterests you. Immediately you feel the need to comment something, rightthen. The world must know about what you have to say. So, you type aquick comment. Soon, you get a reply and are suddenly having aconversation on a topic that you, in fact, don‚Äôt really know much about. So what do you do? Keep having the conversation? It seems as thoughthere‚Äôs no other choice. You can‚Äôt just log off and leave peoplehanging. So you keep talking, thinking it doesn‚Äôt matter. Who cares ifyou‚Äôre wrong? This very well might not be you. But the truth is, some people just feelthe need to talk, so, knowing that they‚Äôll never actually meet theperson they‚Äôre talking to and knowing they‚Äôre not going to have toactually face the consequences of giving said person misinformation,they just keep going. This is really something you need to be watchfulof. Telling other people something that isn‚Äôt true and presenting it asfact can mislead lots of people, and can also harm your reputation. Or maybe, instead of talking off the top of your head, you speak inextremes. You might say that you hate something that you see, but reallyjust mildly dislike it. Or perhaps you see something that makes youchuckle a bit, and then say that it was so funny that you were dying oflaughter. ¬† Exaggerating is an easy thing to do on the internet. You want people tolike what you say, to agree with you. So instead of giving an honestreply, you turn your comment into something it‚Äôs not, solely for thesake of making more people agree with you. This isn‚Äôt a really terriblething, but try to keep it real. While it‚Äôs okay to exaggerate a bit, youmight end up having a real conversation when you dial it down a fewnotches too. The last thing people do online is be completely silent. Now this maynot sound as bad, and it isn‚Äôt a big problem, especially compared to theother things I‚Äôve been writing about. But you do have social media tobe, well, social. Don‚Äôt be so afraid to say something that it keeps youfrom saying anything entirely. A good thing to keep in mind wheninteracting with others on the internet is to say something positive, asopposed to negative. And if someone says something negative to you, tryto be mature. You don‚Äôt have to reply, but if you do, make sure that youaren‚Äôt being rude or impolite. The best thing to do is just let it go. You didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, the other person did, so don‚Äôt let thembother you. All in all, just pay attention to what exactly it is that you‚Äôre sayingonline. It‚Äôs quite easy to misinterpret what anyone could say when it‚Äôswritten down, as you don‚Äôt have facial expressions or emphasis to guideyou. So be careful, and try to assume the best. You catch more flieswith honey than vinegar. egar. . egar. "

This makes up for the time spentthinking, working, and scrambling to get through it all. By December,many people are exhausted, and wish to start over. Awaiting them is anew year. The prospect of something new makes us feel like there‚Äôsnothing we can‚Äôt do, because anything is possible for the future. Thus,we reflect on our past year, and figure out what to do differently fromnow on. With this come our resolutions. People get excited about thechanges they will make to better themselves and their lives. Many can‚Äôtwait for New Years, and all the apparent bliss that comes with it. However, after New Years, what happens to these resolutions? According to Forbes, studies have shown that less than 25% ofindividuals stay committed to their New Year's Resolutions after just30 days, and only 8% actually accomplish them. These statisticsgive rise to the question: why don‚Äôt people keep their resolutions? People tend to fall back into old habits. After the atmosphere ofoptimism surrounding New Years is gone, people will return to the samelifestyles they led before without a thought. Even if they want to alteran aspect of their life, they will live in the same way, and forgetabout their resolutions. Also, we forget that making changes in life takes effort. A lot ofpeople are not willing to try for the small things they want. Stickingto a resolution is easier said than done, and people feel better notattempting something, than trying and possibly failing. Lastly, there is not much motivation to go through with one‚Äôsresolutions. New Years is smack in the middle of winter, which is aseason of comfort. The feelings of laziness and sleepiness we feel makeit difficult to want to do anything. This is especially true if yourresolution includes getting out of the house.

Closeyour eyes and read the following. You begin as a piece of cheap fabric that required 2700 litres of water(an average person drinks this in 2. 5 years).

This exposes theperceived benefit of $20 jeans that last for a very short amount oftime due to its cheap materials.

Now that you have learned about the harms of the fashion industry, learnabout what you, the consumer, can do to help.  Reduce the amount of clothing you buy from fast fashion stores, or     even better, stop shopping there altogether. Shop from thriftstores or stores that sustainably produce their items. Thedecreasing demand is sure to change their manufacturing processes.     Instead of throwing out your clothing, donate it to stores that     accept them or your friends/family.

    "title": "The Reasoning Behind Spider-Man‚Äôs Exit from the MCU",
    "body": "2019/11/10 - If you‚Äôre a Marvel fan like me, then you‚Äôve probably heard about therecent drama between Sony and Disney regarding Spider-Man. If youhaven‚Äôt heard about what is happening, here‚Äôs a summary. Sony has ownedthe film rights to Spider-Man since 1998. In 2015, they made a deal withDisney, agreeing to lend the character of Spider-Man to Marvel Studios,a company owned by Disney, and to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. As wehave seen over the last few years, Tom Holland‚Äôs Spider Man has played alarge role in many Marvel movies. Recently, Sony and Disney haverevisited their deal, and gone through negotiations about future stepsfor the Spider-Man character. On August 20th, 2019, Sony announced thatKevin Feige, president of Marvel Studios, won‚Äôt be playing a role in theproduction of the next Spider-Man film. This means that Spider-Man iscurrently not a part of the MCU anymore. This news left fans feelingboth angry and heartbroken, since Marvel‚Äôs latest movie, ‚ÄúSpider-Man:Far From Home‚Äù had set up Spider-Man to be the new face of thefranchise. Upon hearing about this, I didn‚Äôt understand what happenedbetween the two major companies, and wanted to know the reason behindthe decisions being made. ¬† Sony owns the rights to Spider-Man and gets to keep them as long as theymake a new Spider-Man movie every five to six years. They started with‚ÄúSpider-Man‚Äù in 2002, starring Tobey Maguire. After its success, theyproceeded to release ‚ÄúSpider-Man 2‚Äù, and then ‚ÄúSpider-Man 3‚Äù in 2007. The third movie didn‚Äôt do quite as well as hoped, costing $260 millionto make, with profits dipping significantly from the first two movies. ¬† Five years later, Sony decided to reboot the series, and released ‚ÄúTheAmazing Spider-Man‚Äù starring Andrew Garfield. This movie made over $700million worldwide. With its success,‚ÄùThe Amazing Spider-Man 2‚Äù was made. Unfortunately, it did not live up to Sony‚Äôs expectations, with the veryhigh production costs and lessened excitement from fans. ¬† Because of their failed attempts, Sony struck a deal with Disney in  Marvel would be able to use Spider-Man in their cinematicuniverse, while Sony kept distribution rights and creative control. Sonyproducer, Amy Pascal, who played a big role in the creation of theSpider-Man movies since 2002, produced  Spider-Man: Homecoming  and Spider-Man: Far From Home  with Kevin Feige. This deal had beenupheld by both sides, until Sony decided to revisit the idea of makingtheir own Spider-Man films. ¬†Recently, Sony has been doing well with their own ‚ÄòUniverse of MarvelCharacters‚Äô. ‚ÄúVenom‚Äù made over $800 million worldwide after beingreleased in 2018, and ‚ÄúSpider-Man: Far From Home‚Äù made over $1 billionthis summer. These successes have been ‚Äújust the rebound Sony needed. ‚ÄùSpider-Man is Sony‚Äôs greatest property, and they are highly motivated tokeep it in their control. . This is why they had such an interest intaking back the character. Another reason why the deal was beingrevisited was because Disney wanted a 50/50 stake in future Spider-Man  movies. Sony wanted to keep the deal as is: where Marvelreceives up to 5% of first-dollar gross and all merchandising revenue. As of right now, no new deal has been made. This indicates that unlesssomething changes, Marvel Studios will not be involved in the making ofnew Spider-Man movies, and no MCU characters will be referenced. Sonyhopes that Director John Watts and star Tom Holland will return for twomore Spider-Man films. Even though this feels like a big loss for fans,we should remember that there are still more movies being made, and eventhough Marvel seems to be out of Spider-Man's life right now, Sony ishopeful that a deal could still be made in the future. ¬† *Note: This article was written before the agreement between Sony andDisney to keep Spiderman in the MCU was reached.

    "body": "2019/11/10 - Remembrance Day Remembrance Day (Jour du Souvenir) is observed annually on November11, the anniversary marking the end of World War 1. ¬† The First World War was the largest conflict the world had ever seen atthe time. The war was a result of many factors, including politicaltension and military alliances. The assassination of Archduke FranzFerdinand of Austria in 1914 sparked the beginning of a crisis and thewar began that same year in August. It would become a bloody four yearwar with close to 61,000 Canadians killed. Originally the day was called ‚ÄúArmistice Day‚Äù to commemorate thearmistice agreement which ended the war on Monday, November 11, 1918, at11 a. m, the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month. ¬† Vimy Ridge Considered Canada‚Äôs most celebrated Canadian military victory, thebattle of Vimy Ridge was fought from the 9th to 12th of April 1917 onthe Western Front of northern France. Four divisions of the CanadianCorps fought united and captured the ridge from the German army. It wasthe largest territorial advance of any Allied force at that point in thewar. Unfortunately the cost of the victory was overwhelming; more than10,600 Canadians were killed or wounded in the battle. Today a memorialstands at the top of the ridge to honour the 11,285 Canadians killed inFrance throughout the war who have no marked graves. Remembering¬† The day serves to remember all the lives that were lost in the line ofduty and the countless sacrifices soldiers made to uphold internationalpeace. Historically there is a National Ceremony on the date each year at theNational War Memorial in Ottawa. It is nationally televised and attendedby the Prime Minister, government officials, veterans organizations‚Äôrepresentatives, diplomatic representatives, dignitaries, veterans aswell as the general public. What Can You Do? ‚Ä¢Remember those who served and the fallen. Honour their sacrifice. ‚Ä¢Have a respectful moment of silence ‚Ä¢Wear the Remembrance Day symbol, a poppy, with the correct etiquette,that is: on the left over your heart, from the last Friday in Octoberuntil November 11 Image source:  Remembrance DayPoppy_2= ¬†by¬†Sheba_Also46000 + photos-Videos¬†is licensed under¬†CC BY-SA2. 0¬†ich)* "

The air seemsfresher and catching a sunrise is always a welcome sight. You might evenhave a bit of time to be productive! So without further ado, here aresome tips so you can maximize your mornings! Go to sleep earlier! This one is pretty straightforward. You need adequate sleep to maintainyour health and sanity! What if you have an assignment? Try sleepingearlier and then waking up earlier to finish it before school starts. Help your circadian rhythm by sticking to a regular sleep scheduleincluding on weekends! Setting/choosing an alarm Sure, annoying alarms will get you up but it‚Äôll also put you in a badmood to start your morning. It‚Äôll leave you feeling murderous. Talkabout waking up on the wrong side of your bed. . . Wake up earlier than you normally do I find that when my alarm goes off getting up is crucial. Lingeringunder your covers might be tempting but it also makes you feel moresluggish and loses precious time for your body to get used to beingawake before you‚Äôre off to class. Force yourself to get out of bed!It‚Äôll depend on each person but 6am-7am is a good time to wake up. Open your curtains! Natural lighting = very good. Crack open your window for fresh air andto hear the birds chirp! Put on some music! Music can set up the atmosphere and instantly improve your mood in themorning! You could play your favorite jam to get you pumped up or a nicesoundtrack for a calming and happy effect. Water is your best friend Your body hasn‚Äôt had any water for hours by now! Down a glass of freshH‚ÇÇO to rehydrate and splash your face with cold water to get refreshed. You can opt for a quick shower too! Breakfast isn‚Äôt negotiable If you‚Äôre like me you‚Äôre probably guilty of skipping this vital part ofyour mornings. A healthy breakfast improves your memory and mood andhelps you stay concentrated. It‚Äôs key for productivity. Recently I‚Äôveleaned towards a small bowl of cereal or toast, some fruit and a cup ofgreen tea or coffee! Exercise Some people may find a walk or run in the morning really helpsespecially in the morning when the air feels fresher. Or just brave anice cold shower and get a mini heart attack. A warm shower might justmake your drowsier. Plan your day! The key to a good end is a good start! Jot down a to-do list in yourbullet journal, agenda, phone or just think about it on your commute.
